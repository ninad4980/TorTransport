# TorTransport
This code can be used for ion and electron transport in Toroidal      
Magnetic field with constant value. The magnetic gradient can be      
   added. It uses basic Point Jacobi iterative method to solve Poisson   
   in circular toroidal coordinates. This file can be used as basic code 
   for ions in curved magnetic field and can define circular electrodes. 
   Any comments and suggestions are welcome. This is part of ongoing     
   project call F8SR, the storage ring for ions.                         
   For convenience of uploading, code has been put into single file.
